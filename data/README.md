# Datasets

This project involves the analysis of meteorological data collected
over a number of years [from weather stations around the UK][1].  The files
`bradford.txt`, `durham.txt`, `lerwick.txt`, `oxford.txt` and `sheffield.txt`
are cleaned-up versions of five of these datasets.

Each file has the same format, consisting of a four-line **header** and then
a series of **records**, each containing data for a single month.  The fields
in a record are year, month, mean daily maximum temperature (degrees Celsius),
mean daily minimum temperature (degrees Celsius), days of air frost,
rainfall (mm) and number of hours of sunshine.

Test files:

* `bad-file.txt` contains only a single line.

* `bad-year.txt` contains a valid header plus a single record in which
  the year is invalid, where invalid is defined as 'earlier than 1930'.

* `bad-month.txt` contains a valid header plus a single record in
  which the month is invalid - i.e., outside the range 1-12.

* `bad-rainfall.txt` contains a valid header plus a single record in
  which the rainfall value is invalid - i.e., negative.
